            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>We have a team of web developers and graphic design artists that assist us on everything from business
            cards to billboards, animated design, maintaining an existing web site with various minor changes or
            updates- to designing and developing websites from scratch for a very personal touch!</p>

            <p>Throughout 10 + years we have hand selected a very strong group of high quality, hardworking, creative
            and fairly priced vendors for printing, sign production, etc. We bid out between them- knowing that no
            matter who comes in with the lowest bid amount- the job will be done superbly. In doing so- we also
            "Buy Local", all of our print work is done locally.</p>

            <p>One other thing you may want to know: We don't charge retainers or monthly fees, for media
            advertising we are paid a commission from the media companies we place client advertising with. We
            work with budgets and strive to help our clients to succeed- because your success is our success.</p>
